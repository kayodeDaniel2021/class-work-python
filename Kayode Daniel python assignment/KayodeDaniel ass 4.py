# FOR DAY FOUR ASSIGNMENT
# Using the FOR statement.
# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence 
# With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, 

# (i)
# state = ['Ogun', 'Osun', 'Ondo', 'Oshogbo'] 
# for state  in state:
#     print(state)

# # (ii)
# u = 6, 21, 19, 33, 47, 75
# for i in u:
#     print(i + 10)

# (iii)
# num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# for i in num:
#     print('2 x', i, '=', 2*i)

# 2. create your 3 different sets of code 
# using the def and lambda functions each.
# (MAKE EACH ONE string, integers, floats, list)
