# FOR DAY THREE ASSIGNMENT
# Using the following in a set of code created by you

# i. IF ELSE Statement  
# It is used to execute both the TRUE and FALSE parts of a given condition
# If the condition is TRUE, the IF BLOCK CODE is executed
# If the condition is FALSE, the ELSE BLOCK CODE is executed

# score = 132
# score = int(score)
# if score >= 132:
# 	print(score, "Qualified for Secondary School")
# else:
# 	print (score, "Advised to Resit NCEE")


# score = input("Please, Enter Your Scores: ")
# score = int(score)
# if score >= 132:
# 	print(score, "Qualified for Secondary School")
# elif score >=100:
# 	print(score, "eligible to re-write")
# else:
# 	print (score, "Advised to Resit UTME")



# # ii. NESTED DICTIONARY

# # A nested dictionary is a dictionary inside a dictionary. 
# # Below therefore, dictionaries 1 & 2 are inside People NESTED Dictionary

# people = {'Student1': {'name': 'Oluwafemi', 'age': '24', 'sex': 'Male'},
#           'Student2': {'name': 'Oluwakemi', 'age': '20', 'sex': 'Female'}}
# print(people)


# # iii. WHILE LOOP
# # With WHILE LOOP we can execute a set of 
# # statements as long as a condition is true.
# # For example, if we want to show a message 100 times,
# # then we can use a loop. 

# # A WHILE loop evaluates the condition
# # If the condition evaluates to True,
# # the code inside the while loop is executed.
# # condition is evaluated again.
# # This process continues until the condition is False.
# # When condition evaluates to False, the loop stops.
# #
# #
# # program to display numbers from 1 to 5

# # initialize the variable
# i = 1
# n = 8
# while i <= n:
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1


# # iv. FOR loop in List and Tuples
# # A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence With the for loop 
# we can execute a set of statements, 
# # once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

# (a) FOR loop in List
# x = ["Matthew", "Mark", "Luke", "John"]
# NewTestament = ["Matthew", "Mark", "Luke", "John"]
# print(x)


# (b) FOR loop in Tuples
# Iterating through a Tuple.
# We can use the FOR loop to iterate over the elements of a tuple. 
# For example,

# x = ('Black', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Gold')
# Color = ('Black', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Gold')
# # for x in languages:
# print(x)


# # v. WHILE COUNT
# # It's used to have the computer repeat something a specific number of times.

# counter = 1
# while counter < 10:
#     counter += 1
# print("Counter:", counter)


# # vi. WHILE TRUE
# # A while loop statement repeatedly executes a target statement
# # as long as a given condition is true.
  
# N = 5
# Sum = 0
# while True:     
#     Sum += N 
#     N -= 1
# # the below condition will tell the loop to stop 
#     if N == 0: 
#         break        
# print("Sum of First 10 Numbers is: ", Sum)
